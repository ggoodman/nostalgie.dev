# Routing

Nostalgie routing is exposed by the `nostalgie/routing` module.

Currently, the routing support in Nostalgie is a direct export of a subset of the features in [`react-router-dom`](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start). These are re-exported so that Nostalgie doesn't accidentally pick up multiple competing copies of the (`react-router-dom`)[https://npm.im/react-router-dom] package.

Nostalgie integrates deeply with `react-router-dom` and as such, there is no need to wrap your app in a `<BrowserRouter />`. Your page will be automatically wrapped with a `<BrowserRouter>` during CSR and it will be wrapped with a `<StaticRouter>` during SSR.

```tsx emphasize:7-8 emphasize:11-19 lines
import { Link, Route, Switch } from 'nostalgie/routing';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <nav>
        <Link to="/a">Page A</Link>
        <Link to="/b">Page B</Link>
      </nav>
      <main>
        <Switch>
          <Route exact path="/a">
            Page A Content
          </Route>
          <Route exact path="/b">
            Page B Content
          </Route>
          <Route path="/">Initial Content</Route>
        </Switch>
      </main>
    </>
  );
}
```
